    <h1>No Time To Pray</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>By K. J. Koshy</h2>
    <br />
    <p>I knelt to pray but not for long,<br>
        I had too much to do.<br>
        I had to hurry and get to work<br>
        For bills would soon be due.<br>
        <br>
        So I knelt and said a hurried prayer,<br>
        And jumped up off my knees.<br>
        My Christian duty was now done<br>
        My soul could rest at ease.<br>
        <br>
        All day long I had no time<br>
        To spread a word of cheer.<br>
        No time to speak of Christ to friends,<br>
        They'd laugh at me I'd fear.<br>
        <br>
        No time, no time, too much to do,<br>
        That was my constant cry,<br>
        No time to give to souls in need<br>
        But at last the time, the time
        to die.<br>
        <br>
        I went before the Lord,<br>
        I came, I stood with downcast eyes.<br>
        For in his hands God held a book;<br>
        It was the book of life.<br>
        <br>
        God looked into his book and said<br>
        "Your name I cannot find.<br>
        I once was going to write it down...<br>
        But never found the time"<br>
        <br>
    </p>
